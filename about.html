				A cupcake is a small designed to serve one person,which may be baked in a small thin paper 
				or aluminum cup. As with large cakes,icing and other cake decoration such as fruit and candy
				may be applied. Cupcakes seem uniquely suited to our modern sensibilities. 
				they are portion controlled, portable, easy to make in batches, open to lots of decorating, tasty 
				and be inexpensive to make.

				The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, 
				such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.
